/// The [compile] function from this library translates a [Regex] to an [Nfa]
/// state graph that can then be used to match an input string.
///
/// The compilation process is executed in these steps:
///  1. The [Regex.pattern] string is split into tokens. Token types are defined
///     in `token.dart`. Token recognition is implemented in `lexer.dart`.
///  2. The tokens are parsed into a syntax tree. The syntax tree is defined in
///     `ast.dart`. The parser is implemented in `parser.dart`.
///  3. The syntax tree is translated into a nondeterministic state machine.
///     This is implemented in [compile].
///  4. [Scanner.unambiguous] and [Scanner.ambiguous] pass the result from
///     [compile] to [powersetConstruction] to convert it to an equivalent
///     deterministic state machine.
///
/// In the [Nfa], [Literal]s and [Wildcard]s are represented by a single
/// [NState], and [CharacterSet]s are represented by one [NState] per element in
/// [CharacterSet.codePoints]. Non-[AtomicExpression]s are not represented in
/// the state machine at all â€“ they were only needed to define the transitions
/// between states.
